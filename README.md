# Rice Diseases Classification 

## Project Overview

Plant diseases are one of the causes in the reduction of quality and quantity of agriculture crops. Reduction in both aspects can directly aï¬€ect the overall production of the crop in a country. The main problem is a lack of continuous monitoring of the plants. Sometimes newbie farmers are not aware of the diseases and its occurrence period. Generally, diseases can occur on any plant at any time. However, a continuous monitoring may prevent disease infection.
The detection of a plant disease is one of the important research topics in the agriculture domain (Prajapati, Shah and Dabhi, 2016).

The goal of this project is to build and train a model to analyze images of rice plant leaves and identify its diseases based on four categories: BrownSpot, Healthy, Hispa, and LeafBlast.
